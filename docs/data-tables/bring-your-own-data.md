# Bring your own data

You can upload your own data to Dune via the API or the UI. This allows you to combine your own data with the data available on Dune. This data could be:

- product data
- custom contract mappings
- labels
- macroeconomic data
- off-chain data like snapshot votes
- on-chain data from blockchains we don't support yet
- ...

Your imagination is really the limit here. The only requirement is that this data does not contain any personally identifiable information or breach any copyright.
