**Raw tables provide you raw, unfiltered and unedited data.**

Raw data tables are very useful to get raw scripts, inputs, and outputs from transactions.

Bitcoin uses a UTXO transaction model, and has a heavy focus on signatures and scripts for "locking" and "unlocking" tokens. They are also most well known for being tied to a 21 million token supply, and halvenings.
